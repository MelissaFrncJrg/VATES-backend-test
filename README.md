Hello dear candidate, 

The goal of this test is to validate your knowledge of Javascript in a NodeJs context.
   
**Create a NodeJs script that will query `/data` of a server for 10 seconds and display the data received successfully.Do not modify the server.**


This project already provides the command `yarn serve` ( or `npm run serve`) to start the server. By default, this server will respond on port 4321, with the following routes : 
* `/` : returns a success message
* `/data` : returns a json object This is the route whose messages we want to collect.

The dependencies can be installed by running `npm i` ou `yarn` from the root of the project


The evaluation criteria are:
* compliance with instructions
* stability
* performance, evaluated as the number of successful responses in 10 seconds
* code quality: in particular, the presence or absence of tests, typing and readability.


The aim is to create a basis for discussion. All the resources at your disposal can be used during the test, provided that you are then able to explain the difficulties encountered and the choices made.

After a maximum of one hour, you must have published your solution in a github repo, private or not, and sent us the link.  We'll then move on to the code review and technical discussion phase together.

Happy coding
